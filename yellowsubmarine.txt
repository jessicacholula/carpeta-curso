In the town where I was born Lived a man who sailed to sea And he told us of his life In the land of submarines So we sailed on to the sun Til we found a sea of green And we lived beneath the waves In our yellow submarine We all live in a yellow submarine Yellow submarine, yellow submarine We all live in a yellow submarine Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends are all aboard Many more of them live next door And the band begins to play We all live in a yellow submarine Yellow submarine, yellow submarine We all live in a yellow submarine Yellow submarine, yellow submarine Full steam ahead, Mister Boatswain, full steam ahead, Captain, captain As we live a life of ease Submarine We all live in a yellow submarine A yellow submarine, yellow submarine We all live in a yellow submarine A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine Yellow submarine, yellow submarine We all live in a yellow submarine Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
